= Shirorekha =

Devanagarai, Bengali and Gurmukhi scripts are written in a way where each word is marked by a line above it called as *Shirorekha*. This connectc all the letters in a word and so segmetation had to be done before the scanned is passed on to the recognizer. 

A Shirorekha segmenter will be made available on this project soon.
